This is a 3D simulator built in SwiftUI where you can add points and see them through a circular camera lens/eye. I've learned it's called a point cloud simulator but it's pretty basic. 

Normally 3D simulations are seen through a rectangular window but in this case it's circular so I think it's closer to an eye.

I don't think anyone's gonna see this but if you do, thank you for stopping by. Hopefully you think it's fun (assuming you figure out what the variables mean which I would not be able to. But if you run the app, hopefully you like it.)
